# There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.
# The rules of the game are as follows:
# Start at the 1st friend.
# Count the next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.
# The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.
# If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.
# Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game.
# Given the number of friends, n, and an integer k, return the winner of the game.
